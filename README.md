# Googleformimages
A program which takes black and white images and draws them on google forms within a 9x7 checkbox grid.

This is not very useful.

NOTE: This most likely will not work on all screen resolutions, it is intended for 1920x1080. (you can change the code to try and fix this if you arent on 1920x1080)

# Setting up the program

1: Enter the file locations for your source image folder and your export folder.

# Setting up the google form

1: Create a google form with the only question being a checkbox grid.

2: Create 7 rows and 9 columns with whitespace names.

3: Set the theme to all black.

4: Click on the "preview" button.

5: Enter fullscreen.
